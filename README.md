# Structure learning with PyMC3

> Demo how one could use PyMC3 to learn the structure of a Bayesian network.

## About

If you are interested in probabilistic programming using `PyMC3` and also love Bayesian networks this repository is for you.
The code in `bn` shows how one could implement structure MCMC to learn the structure of a Bayesian network.

The code is probably still buggy at some places, but the concept works. So enjoy with care! 
It would be great if someone actually put that into `PyMC3` or `PyMC4`.

If there are any questions, just open up an issue and ask.
